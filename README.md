# AI Resume Analyzer using Flask & Google Gemini AI

An AI-powered web application that analyzes resumes and provides intelligent feedback using Google's Gemini AI. Users can paste their resume into the application, and the AI generates a structured analysis including strengths, weaknesses, missing skills, and suggestions for improvement.


#  Project Overview

The AI Resume Analyzer is a beginner-friendly Artificial Intelligence project built using Flask and the Google Gemini API.
The application accepts a resume as input, sends it to the Gemini AI model for analysis, and displays a detailed report on the website. This project demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated into web applications using Python and Flask.

1. The user opens the website.
2. The user pastes their resume into the text area.
3. JavaScript sends the resume to the Flask backend using a POST request.
4. Flask receives the resume and creates a prompt for the Gemini AI model.
5. The backend sends the prompt to the Gemini API.
6. Gemini analyzes the resume.
7. The AI returns a structured response.
8. Flask sends the response back to the frontend.
9. The website displays the analysis instantly.
